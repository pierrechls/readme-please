# readme-please

> Simple CLI to easily generate a README file from a specific and customizable template

![preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pierrechls/readme-please/master/assets/preview.gif)

A rich and explicit README is really **important** to present the project and eventually explain how to use it. A README have to be **organized** and look **sexy** (with emoji is ~~better~~ cool). But, when you start your project, create a README file is a **boring** task. That's why I decided to create a command line to make this process **quick** and **easy**, generating a README file where you only have to complete it with the project informations.

## :rocket: How to use it

#### Install readme-please as a global package

```bash
$ npm i -g readme-please
```

#### Have fun

```bash
$ readme-please --help            # or -h (see all possibles options)
$ readme-please --list            # or -l (list existing templates)
$ readme-please --force           # or -f (overwrite the existing README file)
$ readme-please --template [name] # or -t (generate from a specific template)
```
